            Account Owner: An account owner is the organization or individual
            that signs up for a SEEYOU account. Typically, an account owner
            designates one or more people (called an “administrator”) to manage
            their account and can grant privileges to users on the account.
            Depending on their license with SEEYOU, the account owner can
            authorize additional users on their account, and the account owner
            can create and/or access the profile information for all users on
            their account. The account owner and their users can invite others
            (including guests not on their account) to meetings or webinars
            hosted on their account.

        out-of-meeting messages, can be created or sent, and what third-party
        apps can be used, for meetings and webinars hosted on their account.
        Depending on their settings, account owners and the people they
        designate can access personal data for people who join meetings and
        webinars on their account or send messages to users on their account.
