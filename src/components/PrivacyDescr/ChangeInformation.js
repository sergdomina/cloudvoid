      <Subtitle>Data Transfers</Subtitle>
      <Discription>
        We maintain servers around the world and your information may be
        processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data
        protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more
        protection than others. Regardless of where your information is
        processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We
        also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of
        data. When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by
        contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the
        appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection
        authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your
        data that we cannot resolve with you directly.

      <Subtitle>International data transfers</Subtitle>
      <Discription>
        SEEYOU operates globally, which means personal data may be transferred,
        stored (for example, in a data center), and processed outside of the
        country or region where it was initially collected where SEEYOU or its
        service providers have customers or facilities – including in countries
        where meeting participants or account owners hosting meetings or
        webinars that you participate in or receiving messages that you send are
        based.
      </Discription>
      <Discription>
        Therefore, by using SEEYOU Products or providing personal data for any
        of the purposes stated above, you acknowledge that your personal data
        may be transferred to or from the United States as well as in other
        countries outside of the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK at the discretion
        of SEEYOU. Such other countries may have data protection rules that are
        different and less protective than those of your country.
      </Discription>
      <Discription>
        We protect your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy
        wherever it is processed and take appropriate contractual or other steps
        to protect it under applicable laws. Where personal data of users in the
        EEA, Switzerland, or the UK is being transferred to a recipient located
        in a country outside the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK which has not been
        recognized as having an adequate level of data protection, we ensure
        that the transfer is governed by the European Commission’s standard
        contractual clauses. Please contact us if you would like further
        information in that respect.

      <CollectsDiscription>
        We only use your information in a lawful, transparent, and fair manner.
        Depending on the specific personal data concerned and the factual
        context, when SEEYOU processes personal data as a controller for
        individuals in regions such as the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK, we rely
        on the following legal bases as applicable in your jurisdiction:
      </CollectsDiscription>
      <DiscriptionList>
        <li>
          <CollectsDiscription>
            As necessary for our contract: When we enter into a contract
            directly with you, we process your personal data on the basis of our
            contract in order to prepare and enter into the contract, as well as
            to perform and manage our contract (i.e., providing SEEYOU Products,
            features and services to account owners, their users, and those they
            invite to join meetings and webinars hosted on their accounts, and
            manage our relationship and contract, including billing, compliance
            with contractual obligations, and related administration). If we do
            not process your personal data for these purposes, we may not be
            able to provide you with all Products, features, and services;
          </CollectsDiscription>

            Consistent with specific revocable consents: We rely on your prior
            consent in order to utilize cookies to engage advertising and
            analytics partners to deliver tailored advertising and analysis of
            our website usage. You have the right to withdraw your consent at
            any time by visiting our cookie management tool;

        </li>
        <li>
          <CollectsDiscription>
            As necessary to comply with our legal obligations: We process your
            personal data to comply with the legal obligations to which we are
            subject for the purposes of compliance with EEA laws, regulations,
            codes of practice, guidelines, or rules applicable to us, and for
            responses to requests from, and other communications with, competent
            EEA public, governmental, judicial, or other regulatory authorities.
            This includes detecting, investigating, preventing, and stopping
            fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, or illegal activity (“fraud and
            abuse detection”) and compliance with privacy laws;

        <li>
          <CollectsDiscription>
            To protect your vital interests or those of others: We process

            purpose of detecting and preventing illicit activities that impact
            vital interests and public safety, including child sexual abuse
            material; and

        <li>
          <CollectsDiscription>
            As necessary for our (or others') legitimate interests, unless those
            interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and
            freedoms, which require protection of personal data: We process your
            personal data based on such legitimate interests to (i) enter and
            perform the contract with the account owner and/or reseller
            providing you with the Products (which includes billing, compliance
            with contractual obligations, and related administration and
            support); (ii) develop, test, and improve our Products and
            troubleshoot products and features; (iii) ensure authentication,
            integrity, security, and safety of accounts, activity, and Products,
            including detect and prevent malicious conduct and violations of our
            terms and policies, prevent or investigate bad or unsafe
            experiences, and address security threats; (iv) send marketing
            communications, advertising, and promotions related to the Products;
            and (v) comply with non-EEA laws, regulations, codes of practice,
            guidelines, or rules applicable to us and respond to requests from,

            meet our corporate and social responsibility commitments, protect
            our rights and property and the ones of our customers, resolve
            disputes, and enforce agreements.

            Opt out of the “sale” of personal data. We do not sell your personal
            data in the conventional sense. However, like many companies, we use
            advertising services that try to tailor online ads to your interests
            based on information collected via cookies and similar technologies
            about your online activity. This is called interest-based
            advertising. The CCPA’s statutory definition of the term “sale” is
            broad and may include interest-based advertising. You can get more
            information and opt out of the use of cookies on our sites for
            interest-based advertising purposes by clicking the Do Not Sell My
            Personal Information link, in the webpage footer, and setting your
            preferences. You will need to set your preferences from each device
            and each web browser from which you wish to opt out. This feature
            uses a cookie to remember your preference, so if you clear all
            cookies from your browser, you will need to reset your settings.

        To opt out of the use of cookies on our sites for interest-based

      <Discription>
        Under the CCPA, only you or an authorized agent may make a request
        related to your personal data. Note that to respond to your requests to
        access or delete personal data under the CCPA, we must verify your
        identity. We may do so by requiring you to log into your SEEYOU account
        (if applicable), provide information relating to your account (which
        will be compared to information we have, such as profile information),
        give a declaration as to your identity under penalty of perjury, and/or
        provide additional information. You may designate an authorized agent to
        submit your verified consumer request by providing written permission
        and verifying your identity, or through proof of power of attorney.
